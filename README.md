Hi ! I’m Nathan Zwahlen, french acoustics & vibrations engineer and self-taught audio/mixing engineer,
and welcome to my Github.

You might already get it, sound is a relatively interesting field for me. In this github I'll mostly 
post some audio-related work, such as my IR projects already available here, or small audio-related
plugins. I'm not a professionnal developper so I know my work can be improved and optimized. Still, 
if it can help at least one person I'll consider it worth it ! Mostly working with python, I also 
plan in the future to post work in C++, which I'm currently learning.

If you ever need to contact me, you can at nathan.zwahlen70@gmail.com.
Thanks for passing by, have fun !
