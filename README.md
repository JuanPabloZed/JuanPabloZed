PhD student in musical acoustics, acoustics & vibrations engineer and self-taught audio/mixing engineer.

In this github I'll mostly post some audio-related work, such as my IR projects already available here, or small audio-related
plugins. I'm not a professionnal developper so I know my work can be improved and optimized. Still, if it can help at least one person I'll consider it worth it !

If you ever need to contact me, you can at nathan.zwahlen70@gmail.com.
Thanks for passing by, have fun !
